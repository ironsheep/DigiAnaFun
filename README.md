Digital Clock made up of Analog Clock faces - iPhone now, iPad
shortly...

### How’d this Happen?

Wandering the web, I saw an Artists work… was intrigued! I reviewed
videos until I understood how each digit was formed (and planned a few
more shapes) then… one day, in my mind’s eye, I saw how the code should
be organized.

### Then, in four hours...

I sat down to my machine, started an Xcode project, fired up Photoshop
to build some analog clock face "rudimentary parts" and also to generate
a quick app-icon from a well known [icon template][]… and a short "4
hours" later I had this app working in it’s present form! What a fun
project and easy reminder that moving from concept thru to complete
implementation is just getting easier and faster after years of practice
with Objective-C and Xcode!
